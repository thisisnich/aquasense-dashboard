<h2>Features Added/Edited:</h2>

<h3>Feature: Client Component Fix for Convex</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Resolved a `TypeError` related to `createContext` being used in a Server Component by explicitly marking `convex/client.tsx` as a Client Component.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-27</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.0</p>

<h3>Feature: Public Wrapper for Default Organization Creation</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Created a public Convex mutation `organizations:createDefaultOrganizationPublic` to wrap the internal `organizations:createDefaultOrganization` mutation. This allows client-side code (specifically in `app/page.tsx`) to correctly trigger the creation of a default organization without directly calling an internal function, resolving a server error related to function visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-27</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.1</p>

<h3>Feature: Sensor Data Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Added a new Convex mutation `sensorReadings:addSimulatedSensorReading` to generate random sensor data for a selected row. A button has been added to the dashboard in `app/page.tsx` to trigger this function, allowing for testing of the dashboard functionality without a physical farm.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-27</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.2</p>

<h3>Feature: Concurrent Development Script</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Added a new npm script `convex-dev` to `package.json` that concurrently runs `convex dev` and `next dev --turbopack`. This simplifies the development workflow by allowing both the Convex backend and Next.js frontend to be started with a single command.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-28</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.3</p>

<h3>Feature: Simulate MQTT Sensor Readings Page</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Created a new page at `/simulate-mqtt` that allows users to input temperature and humidity values and publish them as simulated sensor readings to a specified MQTT topic and broker. This facilitates testing and development without requiring physical sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-28</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.4</p>

<h3>Feature: Configurable MQTT Topic Prefix</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The system now allows for a configurable MQTT topic prefix, replacing the hardcoded "m5stack". This applies to both the MQTT simulator page and the main dashboard. Users can specify a custom topic prefix to align with their specific MQTT broker setup. The Convex backend has been updated to support this, including changes to `convex/schema.ts` to add `mqttTopicPrefix` to the `systems` table, and modifications to `convex/systems.ts` to filter systems by this prefix. The `app/simulate-mqtt/page.tsx` now dynamically constructs MQTT topics based on the prefix and row number, and `app/page.tsx` includes a UI element for users to input the desired topic prefix, which is also passed to simulated sensor readings.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-29</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.5</p>

<h3>Feature: User Selectable MQTT Topic Subscription</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The dashboard now allows users to select which MQTT topic to subscribe to for displaying sensor readings. When no specific row is selected, sensor readings are filtered based on the global MQTT topic prefix entered by the user. This enhances flexibility in monitoring different data streams.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-29</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.6</p>

<h3>Feature: Dashboard Text Readability Improvement</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Adjusted text color classes in `app/page.tsx` from lighter shades of gray to darker shades (e.g., `text-gray-800`, `text-gray-900`) to improve contrast and overall readability of the dashboard text. Also, modified the global `--foreground` CSS variable in `app/globals.css` to be pure black in light mode and pure white in dark mode for maximum contrast. Additionally, applied `text-gray-900` directly to all `h2` headings and "No X found" messages in `app/page.tsx`.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-29</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0.9</p>

<!-- Reverted Feature: Global Text Styling with CSS Variables (Version 1.1.4) -->

<h3>Feature: Sensor Reading Display Fix</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Corrected the display of sensor readings by updating the `getSensorReadings` query in `convex/sensorReadings.ts` to correctly filter by `mqttTopicPrefix` when no specific row is selected. Also, adjusted the frontend call to `addSimulatedReading` in `app/page.tsx` to align with the backend's updated argument requirements and ensured the sensor readings query consistently uses the selected system's MQTT topic prefix.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-30</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1.0</p>

<h3>Feature: Add Simulated Reading Button Redirect</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Modified the "Add Simulated Reading" button on the main dashboard (`app/page.tsx`) to redirect the user to the `/simulate-mqtt` page when clicked. This provides a clear path for users to access the simulation interface.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-30</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1.1</p>

<h3>Feature: Simulate MQTT Page Styling Fix</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Addressed the issue where the `/simulate-mqtt` page appeared black by explicitly setting a light background color (`bg-gray-100` and `bg-white`) for the page and its content. Additionally, removed the overly aggressive `* { color: black !important; }` rule from `app/globals.css` to allow proper text color rendering based on theme settings.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-30</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1.2</p>

<h3>Feature: Default MQTT Broker for Simulator</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Updated the default MQTT broker URL in `app/simulate-mqtt/page.tsx` to `ws://test.mosquitto.org:8080`. This provides a readily available public broker for simulating sensor readings.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-05-30</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1.3</p>

<h3>Feature: Multi-System MQTT Sensor Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The `/simulate-mqtt` page has been refactored to support simulating sensor readings for multiple independent systems (rows). Users can now add and remove system rows, each with its own set of sensor input fields. The `handleSendReading` function has been updated to publish data specific to each system, identified by its unique row number. This allows for more comprehensive testing and simulation of different farming environments simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-06-20</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.2.0</p>

<h3>Feature: Enhanced Sensor Reading Display on Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The "Sensor Readings" section on the main dashboard (`app/page.tsx`) has been enhanced to display all sensor data points as individual widgets. This includes `airTemp`, `waterTemp`, `humidity`, `lIntensity`, `lDuration`, `co2Level`, and `flowRate`, along with their timestamps. The layout now uses a grid to present each reading in a clear, widget-like format, improving data visibility and user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-06-20</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.2.1</p>

<h3>Feature: Individual Sensor Data Cards on Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The main dashboard (`app/page.tsx`) has been refined to provide a more focused view of real-time sensor data. The 'Systems' and 'Rows' display sections have been removed. Instead, individual cards are now presented for each sensor data point: Air Temperature, Water Temperature, Humidity, Light Intensity, Light Duration, CO2 Level, and Flow Rate. Each card prominently displays the latest value for its respective metric, offering a quick and clear overview of environmental conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-06-20</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.2.2</p>

<h3>Feature: Text Visibility on White Cards Fix</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Explicitly applied the `text-gray-900` class to the main content `div` elements within each card in `app/page.tsx`. Additionally, removed the `color: var(--foreground);` property from the `body` rule in `app/globals.css` to prevent the global foreground variable from overriding specific Tailwind text color classes, ensuring text remains dark and visible on the white card backgrounds regardless of theme.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-06-03</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1.5</p>

<h3>Feature: Convex Backend MQTT Integration (Simulated)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Implemented a simulated MQTT listener in `convex/mqtt.ts` using a Convex action (`startMqttListener`) and an internal mutation (`addMqttSensorReading`). This setup demonstrates how Convex could theoretically subscribe to an MQTT topic (e.g., `m5stack/data/row+/dataList` on `ws://test.mosquitto.org:8080`) and store incoming sensor data in the `sensorReadings` table. Due to Convex's serverless nature, a real-world implementation would require an external, continuously running MQTT client service to interact with this Convex backend.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-06-21</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.2.3</p>
